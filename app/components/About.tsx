                <p>I began my coding journey during the challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic. Starting with Python, I gradually ventured into web development, initially exploring Flask. However, I soon realized the significance of frontend skills and took on the challenge of mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To refine my abilities, I immersed myself in challenging projects on Frontend Mentor.</p>
                <p>In 2022, fate took an unexpected turn when a friend (Hassino) offered me an opportunity in the realm of UI/UX design. Despite having no prior experience in this domain, I enthusiastically accepted the offer and quickly adapted to the role. Known for my ability to learn fast, I completed the design work after six months of dedicated effort.</p>
                <p>I transitioned to the development team, learning on the job and picking up technologies like Angular. Today, I&apos;m a mid-level software developer. Beyond web development, I&apos;m venturing into game development with Unreal Engine 5 and exploring machine learning with a friend (Lil D ðŸ˜‚).</p>
