                <p>My coding journey began during the challenging days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Starting with Python, I soon ventured into web development with Flask but quickly realized the significance of frontend skills. Determined to improve, I took on the challenge of mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, refining my abilities through projects on Frontend Mentor.</p>
                <p>In 2022, my career took an unexpected turn when a friend, Hassino, introduced me to UI/UX design. Despite my inexperience, I embraced the opportunity and spent six months learning and delivering professional designs. This experience unlocked new doors, and I transitioned into the development team, where I tackled learning Angular and continually upskillingâ€”all while balancing the demands of school.</p>
                <p>After about a year of relentless dedication, I grew confident in my abilities and reached out to mentors and professionals, asking how to monetize my skills. This led to a one-month gig that I excelled in, earning me a part-time role while I was still in school. As a part-time developer, I transformed designs, enhanced functionality, resolved bugs, and wrote Selenium tests to ensure quality assurance.</p>
                <p>Upon graduating, my performance earned me a full-time position where I continued to work across both frontend and backend development, improving functionality, conducting rigorous testing, and driving seamless integration. The journey from a beginner experimenting with Flask to a seasoned software developer has been one of grit, growth, and excitementâ€”and itâ€™s only just begun. ðŸš€</p>
